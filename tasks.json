// Explanation:
// version: Specifies the version of the tasks format (should always be 2.0.0).
// tasks: The list of tasks to define.
// label: The name of the task. This will appear in VS Code’s Task Runner menu.
// type: The type of task. Since we're running shell scripts, we use shell.
// command: The command to run. In this case, it's the path to your script (e.g., ./export_db.sh).
// group: This groups the task as either a build or test task. It helps organize the tasks and set defaults.
// problemMatcher: Optional, this can be used to link tasks to problem matchers for error handling, but for simple scripts, it’s usually left empty.
